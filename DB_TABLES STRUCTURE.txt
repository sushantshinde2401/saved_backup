Step 1 – Candidate Creation

A new candidate is created in the candidates table.

This table stores:

candidate_id (Primary Key)

Candidate’s basic details (candidate_name, candidate_folder, path, json_data, created_at).



Step 2 – Company & Customer Details

For each candidate, a new ReceiptInvoiceData record is created.

This contains details from multiple steps of your form flow:

Company details → Company name & account number.

Customer details → Customer name & phone number.

Course selection & invoice info → Includes:

invoice_no (Primary Key for invoices).

Party name, invoice date, amount, discount, GST, final amount.

selected_courses (stored as an array/JSON).

Invoice details → Delivery note, dispatch doc no., delivery date, dispatch through, destination, terms of delivery.



Step 3 – Receipt (Amount Received)

A record is created in the ReceiptAmountReceived table.

It stores:

Unique receipt_amount_id (Primary Key).

candidate_id (Foreign Key → candidates).

Amount received, payment type, transaction date, remark.

invoice_reference (links to invoice_no in ReceiptInvoiceData).

This ties receipts directly to invoices and candidates.



Step 4 – Payment Entry

Payments are recorded in the PaymentEntry table.

Contains:

payment_entry_id (Primary Key).

candidate_id (Foreign Key → candidates).

Payment details (date, mode, amount).

receipt_reference (link back to receipts).

This ensures all payments are traceable against candidates and receipts.



Step 5 – Company Ledger

Financial transactions are maintained in the ClientLedger table.

Stores:

Debit, credit, balance for a candidate.

Linked to both ReceiptInvoiceData and ReceiptAmountReceived.

This table ensures the accounting side stays balanced (tracking money in/out).



Step 6 – Relationships

candidates → owns → ReceiptInvoiceData, ReceiptAmountReceived, PaymentEntry, ClientLedger.

ReceiptInvoiceData → relates to → ReceiptAmountReceived and ClientLedger.

ReceiptAmountReceived → relates to → ReceiptInvoiceData and ClientLedger.

PaymentEntry → relates to → ClientLedger.



👉 In simple terms:

Certificate Selection is the root entity for invoices.

Certificate Selection creates invoices (ReceiptInvoiceData).

Receipts (ReceiptAmountReceived) record payments received against invoices.

Payments (PaymentEntry) record how money is paid.

Ledger (ClientLedger) keeps the financial balance updated across invoices, receipts, and payments.
